# Real time chat in Node

## About

A real time chat application in Node, with Express and Socket.io.

## Features

It features users and rooms. Upon joining a room, the user receives a greeting message from a chat bot.

When a new user either joins or leaves a room, all other users in the same room (and those only) get notified.

Messages are sent in real time. They have a time stamp (server generated).

## Running

Clone the repo and run either `npm start` (or `npm run dev` for using `nodemon`).
